UIImage+PDF
===========

`UIImage+PDF` provides a `UIImage` class category method to render a `UIImage` from any PDF stored in the application bundle. The motivation for this was to enable the easy use of scaleable vector assets in `iOS` apps.


Usage
-----

Add the sources files in the `UIImage+PDF` sub folder to your project. Use the following line to import the necessary methods.

	#import "UIImage+PDF.h"
	
Then simply call one of the `UIImage` class methods as shown here:

	UIImage *img = [ UIImage imageWithPDFNamed:@"YingYang.pdf" atSize:CGSizeMake( 40, 40 ) ];
	UIImage *img = [ UIImage imageWithPDFNamed:@"YingYang.pdf" fitSize:CGSizeMake( 90, 50 ) ];
	UIImage *img = [ UIImage imageWithPDFNamed:@"YingYang.pdf" atWidth:60 ];
	UIImage *img = [ UIImage imageWithPDFNamed:@"YingYang.pdf" atHeight:90 ];
	UIImage *img = [ UIImage originalSizeImageWithPDFNamed:@"YingYang.pdf" ];
	
	UIImage *img = [ UIImage imageWithPDFURL:url atSize:CGSizeMake( 60, 60 ) atPage:1 ];
	
	UIImage *img = [ UIImage imageWithPDFData:data atSize:CGSizeMake( 60, 60 ) atPage:1 ];


The `fitSize:`, `atWidth:` and `atHeight:` methods are particularly useful as they preserve the aspect ratio of the source PDF.

For a full API list consult the header file.

An example project is included in this repository. The important code is in `viewDidLoad:` in `UIImage_PDF_exampleViewController.m`.


ARC
---

_**If your project doesn't use ARC**: you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to `NSData+MD5.m`, `NSString+MD5.m`, `PDFView.m`, `UIImage+PDF.m` and `UIView+Image.m` in Target Settings ==> Build Phases ==> Compile Sources._


Disk Cacheing 
--------------

`UIImage+PDF` now transparently caches all rendered PDFs in `<Application_Home>/Library/Caches/__PDF_CACHE__`. This substantially improves application latency with large PDFs, especially on larger devices. To disable disk cacheing, call:

	[ UIImage setShouldCacheOnDisk:NO ];
	

Memory Cacheing 
--------------

`UIImage+PDF` can now use `NSCache` to cache rendered PDFs in memory. This feature is disabled by default. To enable it call:

	[ UIImage setShouldCacheInMemory:YES ];



PDF file size
-------------

By default Adobe Illustrator saves exported PDFs very inefficiently. For best results, select File -> Save a Copy, select PDF format and then uncheck all the general options. Once you are ready to ship your app, run all your PDF assets through ShrinkIt (see below).

Other vector graphics editors which natively use the OSX Quartz renderer, such as [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/), will create much more compact PDFs.

The amazing devs at [Panic](http://www.panic.com/) have now released a PDF shrinking utility, [ShrinkIt](http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/02/shrinkit-1-0/), which should take a lot of the pain out of a vector asset workflow.
